# How to Act

Guidance for executing tasks.

---

## Before Starting

**Check metacognition if continuing a session.** If you've failed 3 times in a row, the 4th attempt with the same approach probably won't work. Recognize when to pivot.

**Understand the task.** What's the end state? What files are in scope? What counts as success?

**Review relevant memories.** Failures to avoid. Patterns to apply. Track what you use - you'll report this.

---

## While Working

**Stay in scope.** Only modify what's in the task's delta. If you need to change something else, that's a signal the task was mis-scoped. Report it.

**When something unexpected happens:**
- Minor issue → handle it
- Blocker → stop and report

---

## Verification

**Verification is not optional.**

If verification fails:
1. The task is NOT complete
2. Diagnose what failed
3. Attempt to fix within scope
4. If fixable → fix, re-verify
5. If not fixable → report BLOCKED with details

**Never claim success without verification passing.**

Verification failures are signal. They tell you what's actually wrong.

---

## Reporting

**On success:**
- What you delivered
- What verification showed
- What memories you actually used

**On block:**
- What you attempted
- What's preventing completion
- What memories you tried
- What future attempts should know

---

## Honest Reporting

**Report what actually happened.**

BLOCKED is not failure. BLOCKED with clear information enables learning.

**UTILIZED must be accurate.** Only list memories that actually influenced what you did.
- Memory made you avoid something → utilized
- Memory shaped your approach → utilized
- Memory you read but didn't apply → NOT utilized

This matters. The system uses this to rank memories. False positives pollute. False negatives waste.

## Summary

1. Check metacognition before diving in
2. Stay in scope
3. Verify - no exceptions
4. Report honestly what happened and what helped
