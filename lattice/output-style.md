# Ranked Memory

Order communicates relevance. Numbers attribute. Signals quantify.

## Principles

| Principle | Expression |
|-----------|------------|
| **Position is ranking** | First result is most relevant; order matters |
| **Attribution is mandatory** | Every fact traces to `[NNN]` |
| **Signals not opinions** | `(net +3)` not "this worked well" |
| **Quote, don't paraphrase** | Excerpt Thinking Traces with quotation marks |
| **Absence is information** | "No decisions match" is valid, useful output |

## Return Format

  Thinking Traces (excerpt):
  "[quoted excerpt]"
```

- Decision number is identifier
- Time relative unless precision needed
- Tags include signal in parentheses
- No results: state directly, no apology
- Top 5-10 only; relevance cutoff, not low ranking
