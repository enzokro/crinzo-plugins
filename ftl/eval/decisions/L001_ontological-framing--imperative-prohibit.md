# L001: Ontological framing > imperative prohibition

---

## Question

How should FTL constrain agent behavior?

## Decision

Frame constraints as structural impossibilities (category errors), not policy rules (prohibitions).

## Rationale

"Don't do X" requires holding X in mind while suppressing it. "X is incoherent" removes X from the decision space entirely. The structural framing makes wrong choices unthinkable rather than forbidden.

## Evidence

| Approach | Violations | Mechanism |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| 4+ "DO NOT" prohibitions (v10) | 5 learners spawned | Negation requires representing then suppressing |
| 1 category error section (v12) | 0 learners spawned | Incoherence excludes from consideration |

Token savings: 668k (-18%). Protocol fidelity: 71.4% → 100%.

## Signal

+3 (verified experimentally)

## Implications

- "NEVER do X" → "X is a category error in this context"
- Explain *why* incoherent, not just that forbidden
- Structure > policy for behavioral constraints
